# advent-of-code-2020
My solutions to advent of code 2020.

The language of choice is Kotlin since I'm currently learning it. Because I'm studying it as I go, I'll surely do some stuff in an "unorthodox" way :P ("Ã  la Java", since that's my main background), so I'll probably revisit the code a few times as I refine my Kotlin-ish style. I'll also postpone the refactoring and polishing to the next year when I have a bit more time :D.
